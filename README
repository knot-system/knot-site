EIGENHEIM

this is very, very early alpha stage. you should not use this for now. THINGS WILL BREAK! here be dragons:

copy all the files into a directory on your webserver

then add a file 'site/config.php' with this content:

````
<?php

return [
	'auth_mail' => 'mail@example.com'
];

````

replace `mail@example.com` with your e-mail address, for the login code

open the page. see if it works.
log in to a micropub client with your url and add content.

alpha.16

- now the slug gets used for new post links and foldernames

alpha.15

**Breaking Change:** the 'theme/{themename}/config.php' got renamed to 'theme/{themename}/theme.php'. If you use a custom theme, you need to rename the file, or else the custom theme will not load.
The snippets 'header.php' and 'footer.php' were updated to alpha.15

- the default config can now be found at system/site/config.php - don't change anything here, use the config.php in the root directory to overwrite values instead
- renamed theme/{themename}/config.php to theme/{themename}/theme.php
- themes can now have their own config.php (the previous config.php in themes is now named theme.php) that overwrites the system/site/config.php (but gets itself overwritten by the local root config.php)
- new config option 'preview_target_width', to set the image size of preview images independently of content images
- updated the snippets header.php and footer.php to alpha.15

- add_script() now has an additional parameter to include the script in the footer instead of the head

- bugfix for missing pages in the navigation

- cache files, that are older than 30 days, are deleted automatically
- updated default theme to alpha.14, with small design updates
- code cleanup


alpha.13

- link previews now get refreshed asyncronously, so the loading time is much faster
- when a link preview gets generated or refreshes asyncronously, a small icon is displayed to refresh the html that the user needs to click, to prevent layout shifts - the next time the page loads, the new/refreshed link preview will be shown automatically
- link preview cache lifetime is now 6 hours (this may be finetuned in the future)
- cache-buster for CSS and JS files, if debug option is active


alpha.12

The following snippets were updated; only (mostly) whitespace is affected, to make 'view-source' better readable, so you may skip updating your custom theme snippets this time: author_info.php, footer.php, overview.php, page_content.php, pagination.php.
The following snippets need to be updated in your custom theme, if you want to display the new link previews: header.php, post.php

- *NEW*: basic link previews. currently, link previews get refreshed after 24 hours
- default theme: update to alpha.12 with link previews & new tag filter message style
- added a global 'eigenheim.css' stylesheet with relevant styles for the image display. you can remove it in your themes functions.php with remove_stylesheet('css/eigenheim.css');
- added a global 'eigenheim.js' script with relevant functionality for link preview refreshing. you can remove it in your themes functions.php with remove_script('js/eigenheim.js');
- new Cache class for easier cache handling (cache can no longer be disabled, this option may be re-added later)
- new Link class for link preview handling
- HTML beautify, to make 'view-source' better readable
- 'add_stylesheet( $path )': now checks if the file exists at the path before including it
- new function 'remove_stylesheet( $path )'

- much better URL matching in the content (for auto link detection)
- the auto-updater now lists all the snippets in custom themes, that need to be updated (when updating from alpha.12 to a newer version)

- posts are now sorted correctly in reverse chronological order

- thumbnail generator: automatically re-create cache/ directory, if it is missing
- auto-updater: show all release notes for not installed versions, instead of only showing the newest release notes
- code cleanup & code restructuring


alpha.10

the snippet 'post.php' was updated to alpha.10; if you use a custom theme, you may also need to update your css, because the image html changed.

- images are no longer automatically added to the 'content_html' field in posts; they are now instead their own field, 'image_html' (and for the raw url, the field 'image' is now provided; you should use the 'image_html' though, because it comes with a new blurry preview image)
- .png images get now automatically converted to .jpg - this can be disabled via the config.php, see example config in the README
- images now have a blurry preview image, while the big image gets loaded; the image html changed, so you may need to update your custom theme
- html elements get filtered from the post 'content_html'; allowed html elements can be defined via the config.php file, see example config in the README
- micropub endpoint: bugfix for categories/tags list
- bugfix for json and rss feeds
- some more code restructuring
- bugfix for the auto-update code - this should now be ready for use with the next update


alpha.9

some snippets (system/site/snippets/) were update to alpha.9; you need to update them, if you use them in a custom theme: footer.php, header.php, overview.php, page-content.php & post.php

- code restructuring. no new features


alpha.8

you should delete the old '.htaccess' and 'media.php' files and the content of the 'cache/' folder before updating.
if you have a custom theme, you need to split the 'theme.php' into two new files 'config.php' and 'functions.php'. have a look at the default theme for how these files should now look. you also need to update all snippets to alpha.8

- config options for image caching & resizing (see "Additional Options" in the README)
